# Clean-Viz-MOM-LRWD
My attempt for a data cleaning and data visualization technical online assessment by MOM-LRWD. It involves cleaning data from 22 datasets and visualizing certain results.
The task are given in the word documents and the csv files with names starting with SiteA and SiteB are datasets provided for the online assessment.
The R script is my solution for the data cleaning part and it would export a excel file containing the cleaned data. Here, it is the file titled filtered_data_both.
For data visualization, it is written in tableau (see .twb file). This uses the filtered_data_both file and the data type for profile was changed to numerical (whole) and is for classification.
